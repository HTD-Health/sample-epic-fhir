#### Usage guide
1. `Yarn`

2. Provide required data for authorization process (client_id, redirect_uri) 

3. Run app

4. Go to [launching page](https://fhir.epic.com/Documentation?docId=launching) on epic, click try it, then provide required data (your app, and your localhost - remember to add redirect url to your app)
